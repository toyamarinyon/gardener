Gardener
====

Web-developer's toolkit that can greatly improve you HTML & CSS workflow.

Now it supports only `Dreamweaver`. I will continue to support the future many editors.

Description
====

`Gardener` is based on a web tool, [OneClickCss](https://css.miugle.info). `OneClickCss` was darn useful, but I wanted a tool that was editor plugin.

Installation
====

## DreamWeaver

Download [Gardener.zxp](https://github.com/toyamarinyon/gardener/releases/download/v0.2.1/Gardener.zxp) and double-click on it: the Adobe Extension Manager should start automatically and install extension. If you donâ€™t have Extension Manager, you can download it from [here](http://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_download/).
